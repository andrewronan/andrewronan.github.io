## PhD Thesis
- [Nilpotent Groups, Spaces and G-Spaces](https://andrewronan.github.io/docs/Nilpotent%20Groups%2C%20Spaces%20and%20G-Spaces%202.pdf)

## Miscellaneous Material

- [Model structures on topological spaces](https://andrewronan.github.io/docs/model_structures_on_topological_spaces.pdf) (First year PhD project)
- [Finitely generated nilpotent spaces](https://andrewronan.github.io/docs/finitely_generated_nilpotent_spaces.pdf) - A nilpotent space is equivalent to a CW complex with finite skeleta iff its homotopy groups are finitely generated iff its homology groups are finitely generated
- [Simplicial spaces and fibrations](https://andrewronan.github.io/docs/simplicial_spaces_and_fibrations.pdf) - Proof that the realisation of a 'locally trivial' map of simplicial spaces is a Hurewicz fibration. As a consequence, we deduce that the orbit map EG to BG is a Hurewicz fibration whenever G is a topological group with a nondegenerate basepoint
