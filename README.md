## PhD Thesis
- [Nilpotent Groups, Spaces and G-Spaces](https://andrewronan.github.io/docs/Nilpotent%20Groups%2C%20Spaces%20and%20G-Spaces%202.pdf)

## Miscellaneous Material

- Model structures on topological spaces (First year PhD project)
- Finitely generated nilpotent spaces - A nilpotent space is equivalent to a CW complex with finite skeleta iff its homotopy groups are finitely generated iff its homology groups are finitely generated
- Simplicial spaces and fibrations - Proof that the realisation of a 'locally trivial' map of simplicial spaces is a Hurewicz fibration. As a consequence, we deduce that the orbit map EG to BG is a Hurewicz fibration whenever G is a topological group with a nondegenerate basepoint
